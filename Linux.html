        Linux (pronounced LINN-ux) is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world.
        This is different from proprietary software like Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it.
        The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions—or versions—you can choose from.
        According to StatCounter Global Stats, Linux users account for less than 2% of global operating systems.
        However, most servers run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.<br><br>
        <b>The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:</b>
